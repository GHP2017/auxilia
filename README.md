# spotify_dj
A server that runs on a Raspberry Pi enabling several users to enjoy a shared music experience.

## Features
* Collaborative Playlist Building -- share your favorite songs with your friends, and discover their music tastes
* Keep The Party Going -- when the queue drops low, songs that fit the mood are added to the playlist, so you don't have to glue yourself to your phone

* Physical volume and play/pause control
